# Name:
#
#   vector_tools_install.sh
#
# Description:
#
#   This script installs the Vector Housekeeping and Query Performance 
#   Analysis scripts. They are configured to run and cron entries created:
#     - Housekeeping run every day at 11pm
#     - Query Performance Analsys every 2 hours except 10pm and 12pm to
#       prevent any possible interference with House keeping.  
#
# Pre-requisites:
#
#    For the install to succeed this script must be run as a user with access
#    to the target Vector installation configured i.e ingXXsh run.
#
#    Sudo access is required to implement the logrotate for the Vector logs.
#    If this is not available the step will be skipped.
