# Calculate the default number of partitions to use for large tables for Actian Vector-H.
# Based on the current default of using half of the number of cores in a cluster.
# Run this script only after Vector-H has been successfully installed.

# September 7th 2015
# D. Postle

# Updated May 2016 to change the default to one quarter of the cores in a cluster.
# Also increased compatibility to also work on Vector systems that have no 'slaves' file.
